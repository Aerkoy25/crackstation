			<h3>Privacy</h3>
			<p>CrackStation respects the privacy of its users. Our Privacy Policy is simple: We do not keep ANY logs. Your IP address (and any other PII) is NOT saved for any period of time. We do not even cache hash lookups.</p>
			<h3>Legal</h3>
			<p>CrackStation's main goal is to promote the use of properly implemented salted hashing in new and existing web applications. We provide this service to help security researchers demonstrate the importance of hash salting. Any users that choose to use CrackStation as a malicious tool are solely responsible for their own actions. We do not ask (and do not care) where our clients get their hashes, so we are unable to help any law enforcement agency.</p>
