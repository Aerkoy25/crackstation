<h1>CrackStation's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<p>
CrackStation's main goal is to promote the use of properly implemented salted
hashing in new and existing web applications. We provide this service to help
security researchers demonstrate the importance of hash salting. Any users that
choose to use CrackStation as a malicious tool are solely responsible for their
own actions. We do not ask where our clients get their hashes,
so we are unable to help any law enforcement agency.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
CrackStation respects the privacy of its users. Our Privacy Policy is simple: We
do not keep ANY logs. Your IP address (and any other PII) is NOT saved for any
period of time. We do not even cache hash lookups.
