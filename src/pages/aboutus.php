<h1>About CrackStation</h1>

<p>
CrackStation is a security awareness project started by <a href="https://defuse.ca/">Defuse
Security</a>. Its purpose is to raise awareness about insecure password storage in web
applications, and to provide guidance to implementors of user authentication systems. By making
large hash lookup tables freely available to the public, we make it easier for security researchers
to demonstrate why password storage solutions, like non-salted hashing, are insecure.
</p>

<p>
While CrackStation does provide paid services, its goal is not to make a profit. The money is used
to pay for the hardware required to run CrackStation, and any left-overs go toward other security
research projects (the results of which are released into the public domain). You may support
CrackStation and other Defuse Security projects by donating using the PayPal donate button
above.

secure password storage in an authentication system, please contact us. You can find
